# Falcon-AutoCRUD

Makes RESTful CRUD easier.

## Test status

[ ![Codeship Status for garymonson/falcon-autocrud](https://codeship.com/projects/ed5bb4c0-b517-0133-757f-3e023a4cadff/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/134046)

## IMPORTANT CHANGE IN 1.0.0

Previously, the CollectionResource and SingleResource classes took db_session
as a parameter to the constructor.  As of 1.0.0, they now take db_engine
instead.  The reason for this is to keep the sessions short-lived and under
autocrud's control to explicitly close the sessions.

This WILL impact you as your routing should now pass the db_engine instead of
the db_session, and if you override these classes, then, if you have overridden
the constructor, you may also have to update that.

## Quick start for contributing

```
virtualenv -p `which python3` virtualenv
source virtualenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
nosetests
```

This runs the tests with SQLite.  To run the tests with Postgres (using
pg8000), you must have a Postgres server running, and a postgres user with
permission to create databases:

```
export AUTOCRUD_DSN=postgresql+pg8000://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432
nosetests
```

Some tests are run only when testing on Postgres due to only being relevant to
Postgres, such as when testing features to do with Postgres data types.

## Usage

Declare your SQLAlchemy models:

```
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String

Base = declarative_base()

class Employee(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'
    id      = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name    = Column(String(50))
    age     = Column(Integer)
```

Declare your resources:

```
from falcon_autocrud.resource import CollectionResource, SingleResource

class EmployeeCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Employee

class EmployeeResource(SingleResource):
    model = Employee
```

Apply them to your app, ensuring you pass an SQLAlchemy engine to the resource
classes:

```
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import falcon
from falcon_autocrud.middleware import Middleware

db_engine = create_engine('sqlite:///stuff.db')

app = falcon.API(
    middleware=[Middleware()],
)

app.add_route('/employees', EmployeeCollectionResource(db_engine))
app.add_route('/employees/{id}', EmployeeResource(db_engine))
```

This automatically creates RESTful endpoints for your resources:

```
http GET http://localhost/employees
http GET http://localhost/employees?name=Bob
http GET http://localhost/employees?age__gt=24
http GET http://localhost/employees?age__gte=25
http GET http://localhost/employees?age__lt=25
http GET http://localhost/employees?age__lte=24
http GET http://localhost/employees?name__contains=John
http GET http://localhost/employees?name__startswith=John
http GET http://localhost/employees?company_id__null=1
http GET http://localhost/employees?company_id__null=0
echo '{"name": "Jim"}' | http POST http://localhost/employees
http GET http://localhost/employees/100
echo '{"name": "Jim"}' | http PUT http://localhost/employees/100
echo '{"name": "Jim"}' | http PATCH http://localhost/employees/100
http DELETE http://localhost/employees/100
# PATCHing a collection to add entities in bulk
echo '{"patches": [{"op": "add", "path": "/", "value": {"name": "Jim"}}]}' | http PATCH http://localhost/employees
```

Note that by default, PUT will only update, and will not insert a new resource
if a matching one does not exist at the address.  If you wish new resources to
be created, then add the following to your resource:

```
allow_put_insert = True
```

### Limiting methods

By default collections will autogenerate methods GET, POST and PATCH, while
single resources will autogenerate methods GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.

To limit which methods are autogenerated for your resource, simply list method
names as follows:

```
# Able to create and search collection:
class AccountCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Account
    methods = ['GET', 'POST']

# Only able to read individual accounts:
class AccountResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Account
    methods = ['GET']
```

### Pre-method functionality.

To do something before a POST or PATCH method is called, add special methods as
follows:

```
class AccountCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Account

    def before_post(self, req, resp, db_session, resource, *args, **kwargs):
      # Anything you do with db_session is in the same transaction as the
      # resource creation.  Resource is the new resource not yet added to the
      # database.
      pass

class AccountResource(SingleResource):
    model = Account

    def before_patch(self, req, resp, db_session, resource, *args, **kwargs):
      # Anything you do with db_session is in the same transaction as the
      # resource update.  Resource is the modified resource not yet saved to
      # the database.
      pass
```

### Post-method functionality

To do something after success of a method, add special methods as follows:

```
class AccountCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Account

    def after_get(self, req, resp, collection, *args, **kwargs):
        # 'collection' is the SQLAlchemy collection resulting from the search
        pass

    def after_post(self, req, resp, new, *args, **kwargs):
        # 'new' is the created SQLAlchemy instance
        pass

    def after_patch(self, req, resp, *args, **kwargs):
        pass


class AccountResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Account

    def after_get(self, req, resp, item, *args, **kwargs):
        # 'item' is the retrieved SQLAlchemy instance
        pass

    def after_put(self, req, resp, item, *args, **kwargs):
        # 'item' is the changed SQLAlchemy instance
        pass

    def after_patch(self, req, resp, item, *args, **kwargs):
        # 'item' is the patched SQLAlchemy instance
        pass

    def after_delete(self, req, resp, item, *args, **kwargs):
        pass
```

Be careful not to throw an exception in the above methods, as this will end up
propagating a 500 Internal Server Error.

### Modifying a patch

If you want to modify the patched resource before it is saved (e.g. to set
default values), you can override the default empty method in SingleResource:

```
class AccountResource(SingleResource):
    model = Account

    def modify_patch(self, req, resp, resource, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Add 'arino' to people's names
        """
        resource.name = resource.name + 'arino'
```

### Identification and Authorization

Define classes that know how to identify and authorize users:

```
class TestIdentifier(object):
    def identify(self, req, resp, resource, params):
        req.context['user'] = req.get_header('Authorization')
        if req.context['user'] is None:
            raise HTTPUnauthorized('Authentication Required', 'No credentials supplied')

class TestAuthorizer(object):
    def authorize(self, req, resp, resource, params):
        if 'user' not in req.context or req.context['user'] != 'Jim':
            raise HTTPForbidden('Permission Denied', 'User does not have access to this resource')
```

Then declare which class identifies/authorizes what resource or method:

```
# Authorizes for all methods
@identify(TestIdentifier)
@authorize(TestAuthorizer)
class AccountCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Account

# Or only some methods
@identify(TestIdentifier)
@authorize(TestAuthorizer, methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@authorize(OtherAuthorizer, methods=['PATCH'])
class OtherAccountCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Account
```

### Filters/Preconditions

You may filter on GET, and set preconditions on single resource PATCH or DELETE:

```
class AccountCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Account

    def get_filter(self, req, resp, query, *args, **kwargs):
        # Only allow getting accounts below id 5
        return query.filter(Account.id < 5)

class AccountResource(SingleResource):
    model = Account

    def get_filter(self, req, resp, query, *args, **kwargs):
        # Only allow getting accounts below id 5
        return query.filter(Account.id < 5)

    def patch_precondition(self, req, resp, query, *args, **kwargs):
        # Only allow setting owner of non-owned account
        if 'owner' in req.context['doc'] and req.context['doc']['owner'] is not None:
            return query.filter(Account.owner == None)
        else:
            return query

    def delete_precondition(self, req, resp, query, *args, **kwargs):
        # Only allow deletes of non-owned accounts
        return query.filter(Account.owner == None)
```

### Not really deleting

If you want to just mark a resource as deleted in the database, but not really
delete the row, define a 'mark_deleted' in your SingleResource subclass:

```
class AccountResource(SingleResource):
    model = Account

    def mark_deleted(self, req, resp, instance, *args, **kwargs):
        instance.deleted = datetime.utcnow()
```

This will cause the changed instance to be updated in the database instead of
doing a DELETE.

Of course, the database row will still be accessible via GET, but you can
automatically filter out "deleted" rows like this:

```
class AccountCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Account

    def get_filter(self, req, resp, resources, *args, **kwargs):
        return resources.filter(Account.deleted == None)

class AccountResource(SingleResource):
    model = Account

    def get_filter(self, req, resp, resources, *args, **kwargs):
        return resources.filter(Account.deleted == None)

    def mark_deleted(self, req, resp, instance, *args, **kwargs):
        instance.deleted = datetime.utcnow()
```

You could also look at the request to only filter out "deleted" rows for some
users.

### Joins

If you want to add query parameters to your collection queries, that do not
refer to a resource attribute, but which refer to an attribute in a linked
table, you can do this in get_filter, as with the below example.  Ensure that
you remove the extra parameter value from req.params before returning from
get_filter, as falcon-autocrud will try (and fail) to look up the parameter in
the main resource class.

```
class Company(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'companies'
    id          = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name        = Column(String(50), unique=True)
    employees   = relationship('Employee')

class Employee(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'
    id          = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name        = Column(String(50), unique=True)
    company_id  = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('companies.id'), nullable=True)
    company     = relationship('Company', back_populates='employees')

class EmployeeCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Employee

    def get_filter(self, req, resp, query, *args, **kwargs):
        if 'company_name' in req.params:
            company_name = req.params['company_name']
            del req.params['company_name']
            query = query.join(Employee.company).filter(Company.name == company_name)
        return query
```

Alternatively, for arguments that are part of the URL you may use attr_map directly:

```
class CompanyEmployeeCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Employee

    attr_map = {
        'company_id':   lambda req, resp, query, *args, **kwargs: query.join(Employee.company).filter(Company.id == kwargs['company_id'])
    }

```

This is useful for the following sort of URL:

```
GET /companies/{company_id}/employees
```

### Sorting

You can specify a default sorting of results from the collection search.  The
below example sorts firstly by name, then by salary descending:

```
class EmployeeCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Employee
    default_sort = ['name', '-salary']
```

The caller can specify a sort (which overrides the default if defined):

```
GET /path/to/collection?__sort=name,-salary
```

### Paging

The caller can specify an offset and/or limit to collection GET to provide
paging of search results.

```
GET /path/to/collection?__offset=10&limit=10
```

This is generally most useful in combination with __sort to ensure consistency
of sorting.

### Limiting response fields

You can limit which fields are returned to the client like this:

```
class EmployeeCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Employee
    response_fields = ['id', 'name']
```

Or you can limit them programmatically like this:

```
class EmployeeCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Employee

    def response_fields(self, req, resp, resource, *args, **kwargs):
        # Determine response fields via things such as authenticated user
        return fields
```

### Creating linked resources

The collection POST method allows creation of linked resources in the one POST
call.  If your model includes a relationship to the linked resource, you can
include the attributes to use in the new linked resource, and the link will be
automatically made in the database:

```
class Company(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'companies'
    id          = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name        = Column(String(50), unique=True)
    employees   = relationship('Employee')

class Employee(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'
    id          = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name        = Column(String(50), unique=True)
    company_id  = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('companies.id'), nullable=True)
    company     = relationship('Company', back_populates='employees')

class CompanyCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Company
    allow_subresources = True
```

```
cat post.json
{
  name: "Initech",
  employees: [
    {
      name: "Alice"
    },
    {
      name: "Bob"
    }
  ]
}

cat post.json | http POST http://localhost/companies
```

This will create a company called Initech and two employees, who will be linked
to Initech via Employee.company_id.  Note the that CollectionResource subclass
must have the attribute allow_subresources and set it to True, for this feature
to be enabled.

### Bulk operations

You can bulk add entities using a PATCH method to a collection.  If the
collection is defined in the standard way, you are limited to adding to only
that model:

```
class EmployeeCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Employee
```

To add to the employee collection, each operation's path must be '/':

```
echo '{"patches": [{"op": "add", "path": "/", "value": {"name": "Jim"}}]}' | http PATCH http://localhost/employees
```

If you would like to be able to add to multiple types of collection in one
bulk update, define the path and model for each in a special collection:

```
class RootResource(CollectionResource):
    patch_paths = {
      '/employees': Employee,
      '/accounts':  Account,
    }

app.add_route('/', RootResource(db_engine))
```

To add to the collections, each operation's path must be in the defined
patch_paths:

```
cat patches.json
{
  "patches": [
    {"op": "add", "path": "/employees", "value": {"name": "Jim"}}
    {"op": "add", "path": "/accounts", "value": {"name": "Sales"}}
  ]
}
cat patches.json | http PATCH http://localhost/employees
```

All the operations done in a single PATCH are performed within a transaction.

### Naive datetimes

Normally a datetime is assumed to be in UTC, so they are expected to be in the
format 'YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SSZ', and are also output like that.

Sometimes (not often!) you need to store a "naive" datetime, where time zone is
not relevant (e.g. to store the datetime of a nationwide public holiday, where
the time zone is not relevant, and the "real" date/time is simply in the local
time zone, whatever that might be - i.e. the client can treat is as being in
their own localtime.

For cases such as this, simply list the field among the naive datetimes like so:

```
class PublicHolidayCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = PublicHoliday
    naive_datetimes = ['start', 'end']
```

These fields will then be parsed and returned in the format
'YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS', i.e. without the 'Z' suffix.

### Meta-information

To add meta-information to each resource in a collection response, assuming your models are:

```
class Team(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teams'
    id          = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name        = Column(String(50))
    characters  = relationship('Character')

class Character(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'characters'
    id          = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name        = Column(String(50))

    team_id     = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teams.id'), nullable=True)
    team        = relationship('Team', back_populates='characters')
```

Then include the following:

```
catchphrases = {
    'Oliver':   'You have failed this city',
    'Cisco':    "OK, you don't get to pick the names",
}

class CharacterCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Character
    resource_meta = {
        'catchphrase':  lambda resource: catchphrases.get(resource.name, None)
    }
```

To add meta-information to the top level of a single resource response, include the following:

```
catchphrases = {
    'Oliver':   'You have failed this city',
    'Cisco':    "OK, you don't get to pick the names",
}

class CharacterResource(SingleResource):
    model = Character
    meta = {
        'catchphrase':  lambda resource: catchphrases.get(resource.name, None)
    }
```

You can join another table to get the meta information:

```
class CharacterCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Character
    resource_meta = {
        'catchphrase':  lambda resource, team_name: catchphrases.get(resource.name, None),
        'team_name':    lambda resource, team_name: team_name,
    }
    extra_select = [Team.name]

    def get_filter(self, req, resp, query, *args, **kwargs):
        return query.join(Team)

class CharacterResource(SingleResource):
    model = Character
    meta = {
        'catchphrase':  lambda resource, team_name: catchphrases.get(resource.name, None),
        'team_name':    lambda resource, team_name: team_name,
    }
    extra_select = [Team.name]

    def get_filter(self, req, resp, query, *args, **kwargs):
        return query.join(Team)

```

You can even use SQL functions to calculate the values in the meta-information:

```
from sqlalchemy import func

class TeamCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Team
    resource_meta = {
        'team_size': lambda resource, team_size: team_size,
    }
    extra_select = [func.count(Character.id)]

    def get_filter(self, req, resp, query, *args, **kwargs):
        return query.join(Character).group_by(Team.id)

class TeamResource(SingleResource):
    model = Team
    meta = {
        'team_size': lambda resource, team_size: team_size,
    }
    extra_select = [func.count(Character.id)]

    def get_filter(self, req, resp, query, *args, **kwargs):
        return query.join(Character).group_by(Team.id)
```

Or you can determine them entirely programmatically like this:

```
class TeamCollectionResource(CollectionResource):
    model = Team
    def resource_meta(self, req, resp, resource, team_size, *args, **kwargs):
        return {
            'team_size': team_size,
        }
    extra_select = [func.count(Character.id)]

    def get_filter(self, req, resp, query, *args, **kwargs):
        return query.join(Character).group_by(Team.id)

class TeamResource(SingleResource):
    model = Team
    def meta(self, req, resp, resource, team_size, *args, **kwargs):
        return {
            'team_size': team_size,
        }
    extra_select = [func.count(Character.id)]

    def get_filter(self, req, resp, query, *args, **kwargs):
        return query.join(Character).group_by(Team.id)
```

The advantage of using the above method is that the keys can also be determined
at runtime, and may change in difference circumstances (e.g. according to query
parameters, or the permissions of the caller).  To include NO meta at all for
the resource, return None from `resource_meta` or `meta` functions.
